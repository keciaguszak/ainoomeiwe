(Delivery to Europe/Germany). 
I love the gap closing capability of the super but I cannot hit sh!t with swords. I always seem to float a lot higher and longer than intended and I can't come back down to target enemies better. I think I've wasted like 4 super today alone. Is bottom tree worth using for the aim assist in swords or is dash just too good? Any pointers are appreciated. Thanks. I saw that you can combo into your other characters level 1/3 supers on a knockdown if you you do half circle forward/back L+M/H+S but I can't seem to get my other character to come out and do their super.

Am horribly poor I have less than 20g how can I make gold for weapons, armor, mounts and other needed items. I have a new superhero for a game of MampM, but I've found I'm not really sure what Complications might be appropriate. So I will pitch her (long-winded) story and the parts of her personality I have considered, and I hope to get some help! The hero started as a super when she was 18, just trying to do whatever she could to make the world a better place. Noble, if naive.

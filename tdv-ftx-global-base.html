I've just purchased EU England (https://orbxdirect.com/product/eng) by Orbx For FSX: Steam Edition and I'm curious whether getting FTX Global BASE, Vector, and openLC Europe will improve the English scenery or whether these components are included within the England region pack? And are there any recommendations for the best satellite imagery packs for England would be? Would VFR Real Scenery be compatible with Orbx England?

Is the ORBX FTX Global Base pack compatible with REX and FreeMeshX? Would you say that it is worth having in addition to the mods i already have? (REX Texture and FreeMeshX)? Still kinda on the fence about buying it but I'm starting to lean more towards getting it. I am also trying to figure out what exactly the mod adds to the game (other than textures? to make it look better?) Thanks. How to arrange Scenery Library entries in Flight Simulator X? What should be on top and what needs to be lower - especially when ORBX FTX Global + Vector and openLC are installed. Hello all. I am looking to buy the FTX global base pack because of the decent sale it is on right now (~USD). Is it worth that or should I hold off? Will it work okay if I do not have any of the other packs included in it (i.e. The North America openLC, global vectors). Thanks.

This one-of-a-kind event highlights the latest innovations and aims to connect leaders within the fintech industry. I installed FTX GB onto my SSD and FSX:SE is on my main harddrive. Could this be the reason I'm experiencing issues? I've edited all my settings inside FSX as the manual says to, but I'm positive the game is using default textures. 
 Training in all its phases must be intensive . . . It must be intelligently directed so that every individual soldier including the last private in the ranks, can understand the reasons I'd like to share my experience from the past few weeks in moving away from FSX Steam Edition to X-Plane 11. The original reason was that the hard disk where FSX used to live died after a power surge. With my birthday coming up, my brother gifted me XP11 - it was either that, or Vault 76, and I am so glad he picked the right one. As most other FSX players, I have sunk some money the sim over the years: FSX Gold Edition (), FSX Steam Edition (€5), PMDG 737 (), FTX Global Base and Vector.

I've saved up 70 bucks to purchase something right now, but I'm not sure what to do. On one hand, I could buy the qualitywings 787 right now so I have something to do, and wait for another sale (Which I'm not sure if there will be another one this year) and save up until then and buy orbx, chasecam, etc. or, I can buy FTX Global base pack and FTX vector to greatly improve my scenery and bring it to a place I want it, and Until black.

I currently own P3D v4 with a lot of add-ons and thinking of setting up X-Plane 11 as well and use both, I searched online about the different add-ons for X-Plane 11 and I saw that a lot of people are divided for some of the add-ons. (looking for P3D v4 equivalent add-ons for X-Plane 11) Below are all the add-ons I currently own on P3D v4 and I’d appreciate it if you can copy amp paste the list and mention the P3D v4 equivalent add-on for X-Plane 11.

(FTX Global BASE Pack). bought p3d v4 as my fsx kept crashing. im loving the vanilla so far. it runs great compared to fsx. anyway, im going to buy the update for my q400 and active sky next. are there any other add ons I should get? I'm not going to spend more money on PMDG A/C. theyr'e significantly more expensive than the FSX version and I'm not buying it twice. F PMDG. im thinking of getting ORBX for the scenery. Is the FTX global base product good enough or should I get the vector as well? Maybe something else. I have no association with FlyInside and I don't usually write reviews on products. But I'm up on cloud nine after picking this up and feel compelled to share my experience with the P3Dv4 folks who may have found the native VR performance lacking. The new version of FlyInside is an absolute game-changer with frame-rates alone. My frame rate more than doubles when I use this with P3Dv4 on Oculus. P3D on the Rift is now as silky smooth as XP11, and it looks superb with the P3D add-ons I've picke. hello, i recently installed openlc europe ftx global base pack ftx global vector and the latest libraries. in the vector configuration i turned of frozen surface. i also ran the elevation corrections. I also have flytampa amsterdam instsalled but same with or withouth this addon enabled. But i still have these problems.: problem 1 (https://i.imgur.com/CVhEfyy.jpg) it looks like a nighttime picture in some parts of the map and than this problem: https://i.imgur.com/OT32Fn5).jpg water. I thought my old installation of FS9 was massive. ~180GB of add-ons. I am already up to ~250GB with P3D and I need to be selective of what I install until I get a second SSD. Not to mention the money spent is already starting to climb. Some items of note. A solid 60FPS was the norm at all airports even with 100% AI traffic with FS9. After a week of tweaking, I am at a constant 30FPS with P3D with all sliders to the right.

About a year ago, I bought FSX: Steam Edition. I was pretty excited to play it, unfortunately when I did, it was not the experience I had hoped for. I looked into modding it and immediately saw the possibilities. So far I have bought the following mods: 1. Orbx FTX Global BASE 2. Orbx FTX Global VECTOR 3. Orbx FTX Global openLC Europe 4. Orbx FTX Trees HD 5. Orbx FTX EU England 6. REX4 Texture Direct HD with REX Soft Clouds Now. In which order do I install these and is there any other softwar. I saw MSx:SE on sale for 5€ a while back and thought "Hey its so cheap to check out flight siming" (. a little research later Hahaha) Seeing what you can do with Add-ons and spend on them, I had some questions for you: 1. Would you recommend to go with FTX: Global BASE + VECTOR or with one of the FTX: Terrain Region packs initially? 2. What is the main difference between REX Essential Plus, and REX Texture Direct + Soft Clouds? I read individuals using sometimes one, the other or both?. Hey all. Have some extra coin from some Superbowl wagers and I figure I want to buy another ORBX airport. I have KPSP right now and think it's awesome. Love the detail. Curious what other airports some of you purchased and enjoyed. I have my eye on Meigs Field or Eagle County. Mainly looking at the Global Airports as I just have the FTX Global Base. Thanks for any info!. Hey guys, I was quite an avid simmer a number of years ago, but life took over and only now am I looking at venturing back. I repurchased FSX in the Steam Edition and I literally have thousands of dollars (I believe so judging by how broke I became back then!) of add ons. Suffice to say, I have more CPU power now then I did back then, but my GPU power is the onboard Intel HD chip. So I can't even dream of piling on all of my addons. PC Specs are. i5-3470, 8GB RAM running on W10 64Bit. Hi all, I just updated my Prepar3D to 2.2 and installed FTX Global Base+Vector. I know there are a load of tweak guides for FSX but I don't know if there are any similar tools or tips for Prepar3D, or if the optimisations done by LM mean that some older tweaks are outdated or even detrimental. Could I please have some advice on how to set up Prepar3D for the best possible enjoyment? I can post system specs if that is useful. Thanks. I currently am running P3D v2.3 with the latest version of FTX Global Base, and FTX Vector. Anytime I try to add any other scenery to the sim (IE, a simple AFCAD) I end up with the below issue, taxiways disappear entirely. FTX Global and Base. ( FTX Global and Base PLUS an AFCAD for the airport. ( I've tried putting the addon scenery above and below the FTX libraries in the scenery library, it never makes a difference. Hi, Flight sim newbie here - started with FSX SE and upgraded to P3D V3 a few weeks ago. I have also invested in the following add-ons: FTX Global Base / Vector / Europe LC. I am using the Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS X flightstick. I play with realism settings all the way to the right (hard). I have concentrated all of my time up to this point on one aircraft - the Beechcraft Bonanza A36 from Caranado (included in the P3D V3 package). I have been practising take offs, landings, traffic patte. Hi all, After saving some money, I set out on trying to create as realistic flight sim setup as I could with the money I had. Ive watched a lot of videos, read a lot of guides and spent a lot of time trying to achieve what I feel is now an incredible experience. Everything runs very smoothly at a consistent 30fps even with the large amount of addons I have installed. WARNING: This is expensive, and only for those interested in creating a professional setup. Seasoned simmers will already. I sent the email below to a friend interested in expanding himself into the hobby, I realize it's not complete nor does it have every single add-on available but I figured it would give some people (esp newbies) something to work with as they jump in.

I'm just getting started with P3D, and am also running FTX Global Base and Vector. I did a short little jaunt in my C172 G1000 to get familiar with it - KPDK to KLZU. When I got to KLZU, there were no runways. I kept descending just to make sure my perspective wasn't off, but there truly weren't any runways. There were some taxiways and buildings. Looking at my library insertion points, FTX is first, followed by OLC, then a bunch of entries, ranging from Bathymetry to Africa, followed. Global BASE Pack .95 AUD .98 AUD Upgrade your sim!
